# OpenContainers Image Manifest Specification

There are three main goals of the Image Manifest Specification.
The first goal is content-addressable images, by supporting an image model where the image's configuration can be hashed to generate a unique ID for the image and its components.
The second goal is to allow multi-architecture images, through a "fat manifest" which references image manifests for platform-specific versions of an image.
The third goal is to be translatable to the [OpenContainers/runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec)


# Manifest List

The manifest list is the "fat manifest" which points to specific image manifests for one or more platforms.
While the use of a manifest list is OPTIONAL for image providers, image consumers SHOULD be prepared to process them.
A client will distinguish a manifest list from an image manifest based on the Content-Type returned in the HTTP response.

## *Manifest List* Property Descriptions

- **`schemaVersion`** *int*

  This REQUIRED property specifies the image manifest schema version.
  For this version of the specification, this MUST be `2` to ensure backward compatibility with older versions of Docker. The value of this field will not change. This field MAY be removed in a future version of the specification.

- **`mediaType`** *string*

  This REQUIRED property contains the media type of the manifest list.
  For this version of the specification, this MUST be set to `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.list.v1+json`.
  For the media type(s) that this is compatible with see the [matrix](media-types.md#compatibility-matrix).

- **`manifests`** *array*

  This REQUIRED property contains a list of manifests for specific platforms.
  While the property MUST be present, the size of the array MAY be zero.

  Each object in the manifest is a [descriptor](descriptor.md) with the following additional properties and restrictions:

  - **`mediaType`** *object*

    This [descriptor property](descriptor.md#properties) has additional restrictions for `manifests`.
    Implementations MUST support at least the following media types:

    - [`application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`](#image-manifest)

    Manifest lists concerned with portability SHOULD use one of the above media types.

  - **`platform`** *object*

    This REQUIRED property describes the platform which the image in the manifest runs on.
    A full list of valid operating system and architecture values are listed in the [Go language documentation for `$GOOS` and `$GOARCH`](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment)

    - **`architecture`** *string*

        This REQUIRED property specified the CPU architecture, for example `amd64` or `ppc64le`.

    - **`os`** *string*

        This REQUIRED property specifies the operating system, for example `linux` or `windows`.

    - **`os.version`** *string*

        This OPTIONAL property specifies the operating system version, for example `10.0.10586`.

    - **`os.features`** *array*

        This OPTIONAL property specifies an array of strings, each specifying a mandatory OS feature (for example on Windows `win32k`).

    - **`variant`** *string*

        This OPTIONAL property specifies the variant of the CPU, for example `armv6l` to specify a particular CPU variant of the ARM CPU.

    - **`features`** *array*

        This OPTIONAL property specifies an array of strings, each specifying a mandatory CPU feature (for example `sse4` or `aes`).

- **`annotations`** *string-string map*

    This OPTIONAL property contains arbitrary metadata for the manifest list.
    Annotations MUST be a key-value map where both the key and value MUST be strings.
    While the value MUST be present, it MAY be an empty string.
    Keys MUST be unique within this map, and best practice is to namespace the keys.
    Keys SHOULD be named using a reverse domain notation - e.g. `com.example.myKey`.
    Keys using the `org.opencontainers` namespace are reserved and MUST NOT be used by other specifications.
    If there are no annotations then this property MUST either be absent or be an empty map.
    Implementations that are reading/processing manifest lists MUST NOT generate an error if they encounter an unknown annotation key.

    See [Pre-Defined Annotation Keys](#pre-defined-annotation-keys).

### Extensibility
Implementations that are reading/processing manifest lists MUST NOT generate an error if they encounter an unknown property.
Instead they MUST ignore unknown properties.

## Example Manifest List

    "com.example.key2": "value2"
  }
}

# Image Manifest

Unlike the [Manifest List](#manifest-list), which contains information about a set of images that can span a variety of architectures and operating systems, an image manifest provides a configuration and set of layers for a single container image for a specific architecture and operating system.

## *Image Manifest* Property Descriptions

- **`schemaVersion`** *int*

  This REQUIRED property specifies the image manifest schema version.
  For this version of the specification, this MUST be `2` to ensure backward compatibility with older versions of Docker. The value of this field will not change. This field MAY be removed in a future version of the specification.

- **`mediaType`** *string*

    This REQUIRED property contains the media type of the image manifest.
    For this version of the specification, this MUST be set to `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`.
    For the media type(s) that this is compatible with see the [matrix](media-types.md#compatibility-matrix).

- **`config`** *[descriptor](descriptor.md)*

    This REQUIRED property references a configuration object for a container, by digest.
    Beyond the [descriptor requirements](descriptor.md#properties), the value has the following additional restrictions:

    - **`mediaType`** *object*

        This [descriptor property](descriptor.md#properties) has additional restrictions for `config`.
        Implementations MUST support at least the following media types:

        - [`application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json`](config.md)

        Manifests concerned with portability SHOULD use one of the above media types.

- **`layers`** *array*

    Each item in the array MUST be a [descriptor](descriptor.md).
    The array MUST have the base image at index 0.
    Subsequent layers MUST then follow in the order in which they are to be layered on top of each other.
    The algorithm to create the final unpacked filesystem layout MUST be to first unpack the layer at index 0, then index 1, and so on.

    Beyond the [descriptor requirements](descriptor.md#properties), the value has the following additional restrictions:

    - **`mediaType`** *object*

        This [descriptor property](descriptor.md#properties) has additional restrictions for `layers[]`.
        Implementations MUST support at least the following media types:

        - [`application/vnd.oci.image.layer.tar+gzip`](layer.md)
        - [`application/vnd.oci.image.layer.nondistributable.tar+gzip`](layer.md#non-distributable-layers)

        Manifests concerned with portability SHOULD use one of the above media types.

- **`annotations`** *string-string map*

    This OPTIONAL property contains arbitrary metadata for the image manifest.
    Annotations MUST be a key-value map where both the key and value MUST be strings.
    While the value MUST be present, it MAY be an empty string.
    Keys MUST be unique within this map, and best practice is to namespace the keys.
    Keys SHOULD be named using a reverse domain notation - e.g. `com.example.myKey`.
    Keys using the `org.opencontainers` namespace are reserved and MUST NOT be used by other specifications.
    If there are no annotations then this property MUST either be absent or be an empty map.
    Implementations that are reading/processing the image manifest MUST NOT generate an error if they encounter an unknown annotation key.

    See [Pre-Defined Annotation Keys](#pre-defined-annotation-keys).

### Extensibility
Implementations that are reading/processing image manifests MUST NOT generate an error if they encounter an unknown property.
Instead they MUST ignore unknown properties.

# Pre-Defined Annotation Keys
This specification defines the following annotation keys, which MAY be used by manifest list and image manifest authors:
* **org.opencontainers.created** date on which the image was built (string, date-time as defined by [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6)).
* **org.opencontainers.authors** contact details of the people or organization responsible for the image (freeform string)
* **org.opencontainers.homepage** URL to find more information on the image (string, must be a URL with scheme HTTP or HTTPS)
* **org.opencontainers.documentation** URL to get documentation on the image (string, must be a URL with scheme HTTP or HTTPS)
